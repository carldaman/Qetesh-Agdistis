            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my website! I go by Qetesh Agdistis, a name inspired by two powerful deities: "Qetesh," the goddess of nature, beauty, and sexual pleasure, and "Agdistis," a hermaphroditic figure from Greek, Roman, and Anatolian mythology.</p>
            <p>"Hermaphrodite" meaning possessing the reproductive organs of both genders.</p>
            <p>A am a bisexual male who has for many years been obsessed with wearing swimsuits, leotards, lingerie and latex. It started when I was about 13 years old, i loved seeing girls in swimsuits on the beach and swimming pools when most swimsuits were made in a style called "high-leg" where it showed the female body much more beautiful. I always wanted a girlfriend / wife who was a swimmer or gymnast but after many years of wanting this the only alternative was to wear the clothing myself and ive been addicted since.</p>
